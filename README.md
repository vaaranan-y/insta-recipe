# Insta Recipe

## About

This is a web application I developed to act as a type of social media platform for people to share their cooking experiences, dishes, and recipes. I developed this web application out of my passion and interest for cooking, and my interest in full-stack development. The application is a typical CRUD application, built with the MERN stack, with enhanced protective measure to ensure a secure and safe experience for the user. Here are some more details on the tech stack and key components of this project:

- MongoDB
- Express.js
- React.js
- Node.js
- BCrypt
- JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)
